# TEALS Programming Projects, Chapter 1
 from 9/11/20

Each Java Project is a different project number from the book, such as #1 Mississippi and #3 Lady who swallowed a fly


**PP#1**  

##First Version had the below which allowed the caller to pass in an animal name as a parameter to make a full line
```
	private static void produceLadySwallowedAnimal(String animal) {
		String ladySwallowedFly = ladySwallowed + " " + animal + ";";
		System.out.println(ladySwallowedFly);
	}
```
    Second version, in order to stay within bounds of chapter one does not have methods with arguments
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

##Second Version had the below using String objects/variables as below:
```
	static String absurdBird = "How absurd to swallow a bird!";
	static String howCow = "I don't know how she swallowed a cow!";
	static String imagineCat = "Imagine that! She swallowed a cat!";
```
    Third version, in order to stay within bounds of chapter one does not have methods with arguments.  Such as below:
```
	public static void printLnAbsurdBird() {
		System.out.println("How absurd to swallow a bird!");
	}

	public static void printLnHowCow() {
		System.out.println("I don't know how she swallowed a cow!");
	}

	public static void printLnImagineCat() {
		System.out.println("Imagine that! She swallowed a cat!");
	}
```
